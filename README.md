- 👋 Hi, I’m @noahFavelo
- 👀 I’m a software engineer working day to day in JavaScript and React.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on an Ai/Ml integration project as a freelancer.
- 💞️ I’m always open to work / collaborate anywhere, especially in the Web Ai space.
- 📫 You can reach me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahfavelo/
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: about two years ago I built a custom Ai solution, that involved what software engineers would now call RAG, and I am just now realising that I did RAG before it was cool.
